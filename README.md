# sedoc - Systems Engineering Notes

These are personal notes I find handy when I'm doing programming, systems administration, network engineering, and the like.

All material here is available under the MIT license; feel free to do with it what you wish.

## Credit
I got the idea to note from https://github.com/0cjs/sedoc.
